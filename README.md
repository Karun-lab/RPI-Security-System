# RPI-Security-System
This project focuses on the development of a Raspberry Pi-based security system for detecting intruders using a webcam and OpenCV. The system is designed to detect and alert homeowners about potential break-ins or unauthorized access to their homes. The project involves setting up a Raspberry Pi with a webcam and programming it to use OpenCV to capture and analyze live video feeds. The system uses image processing algorithms to detect and track any movement or human presence in the monitored area. When the system detects an intruder, it immediately sends an alert to the securities through the LED system.The proposed system provides a cost-effective and customizable solution for home security, as it uses readily available hardware components and open-source software. It can be easily installed and configured to suit the specific needs of each homeowner, such as setting up specific zones to monitor or adjusting the sensitivity of the motion detection algorithm.Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of using Raspberry Pi and OpenCV for building advanced security systems that are both affordable and effective. With the increasing demand for home security systems, this project offers an innovative solution that can be extended and modified to suit various security needs.
